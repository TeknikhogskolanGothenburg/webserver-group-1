# An agile method

Describe an agile development method, max 1000 words, examples:

* Scrum is an agil developing method founded in 1995. It focuses on WHAT should be developed, rather than HOW you do it.
Characteritics:
Focus on customer benefit/communication.
Transparency - Everyone sees what work and what priorities are being made.
Short iterations, two to four weeks.
Delivery of executable version of the system regularly and early in the project.
Clear line of responsibility between the development team and the rest of the organization.
Separation of decisions: technical decisions in the development team, business decisions by the customer.

* XP / Extreme Programming / was developed due to many projects were interrupted or failed in the timeline of the project plan.
It is based on five values: communication, simplicity, feedback, courage and respect. The customer is in place so that continuous 
COMMUNICATION between the developers and the customer is possible for deciding system requirements and prioritations.
SIMPLICITY, obtained through continuous code restructuring and less focus on documentation and other things but the final system. 
Continuous device tests and many system delivers provide good FEEDBACK. Impopular decisions, for example regarding honesty to the customer
of what they can and cannot deliver, takes COURAGE. RESPECT means to show respect for employees as well as
themselves and do not make changes of other employees code if you have not performed good tests.

* Devops / Development + Operations / Operations consider developers to deliver applications that do not work well enough in the system, 
which increases operating costs. Developers, for their part, think applications are working well in their own environments, and see system
management as a brake pad. Differences in motivation, processes and tools build a wall of incomprehension between the two. Devops are 
supposed to tear that wall.

* Kanban / “just-in-time” delivery process / Developed by Toyota in the 1940's. Kanban shows the power of visual information 
by using sticky notes on a whiteboard to create a “picture” of your work. Seeing how your work flows within your team’s process lets  
you communicate status and receive context for the work.
Four core principles:
1. Visualize Work
2. Limit Work in Process
3. Focus on Flow
4. Continuous Improvement
